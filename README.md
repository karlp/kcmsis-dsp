CMSIS DSP library, built for gcc.

This is just the original unmodified source of the CMSIS DSPLIB code from ARM,
with the include files, and a new makefile to make it easier to use.

This is basically the CMSIS/DSP_Llib/Source plus CMSIS/Include directories from
the full CMSIS distribution package, plus a makefile to make a library.

You should be sure to follow the license of the original CMSIS package!
